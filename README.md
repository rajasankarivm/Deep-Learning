Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN in short) is an advancement in the field of Machine Learning which is capable of generating new data samples including Text, Audio, Images, Videos, etc. using previously available data. GANs consist of two Artificial Neural Networks or Convolution Neural Networks models namely Generator and Discriminator which are trained against each other.
