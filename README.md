# Deep-Learning
Run LogisticRegression_CROSS_VALIDATION.ipynb, SVM.ipynb and KNN.ipynb for same dataset in Google colab.
Clone the diabetes.csv file from the link "https://github.com/rajasankarivm/Deep-Learning"
Set 70% of data for training and 30% data for testing.
Import the models from Sk.learn and compile it with the data.
For Logistic Regression model, cross validation with 3 folds is used and their individual accuracies with mean accuracy is displayed.
For KNN model, confusion matrix is bulit and accuracy is displayed.
