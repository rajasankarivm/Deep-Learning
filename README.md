Run ANN.ipynb in Google colab. 
Clone the Churn_modelling.csv file from the link "https://github.com/rajasankarivm/Deep-Learning". 
Perform categorical data encoding using Label coding for gender and One hot encoding for geography column.
Set 80% of data for training and 20% data for testing.
Feature scaling is carried out using Standard feature scaler in Sklearn preprocessing module.
Intialise, build and complie the ANN with two hidden layers.
Train the model for 100 epochs with batch size 32.
Evaluation of the built ANN model is carried pout for the following specifications:
Geography: France;
Credit Score: 600;
Gender: Male;
Age: 40 years old;
Tenure: 3 years;
Balance: $ 60000;
Number of Products: 2;
Does this customer have a credit card ? Yes;
Is this customer an Active Member: Yes;
Estimated Salary: $ 50000. 
Finally the confusion matrix is plotted.
