Run CNN.ipynb in Google colab. 
Clone the Cat-Dog image dataset from the link “https://github.com/laxmimerit/dog-cat-full-dataset” and "https://github.com/rajasankarivm/Deep-Learning". 
20000 images are given for training and 5000 data for testing.  
Initialise, build and compile the CNN with two convolutional layers.
Train the model for 5 epochs with the given dataset.
Prediction of the image that is not given in Test or train set is made.
