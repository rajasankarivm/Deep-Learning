Run Regression.ipynb in Google colab. 
Clone the Age_Height_Data.csv file from the link "https://github.com/rajasankarivm/Deep-Learning". 
Set 80% of data for training and 20% data for testing. Import the models from Sk.learn linear model and compile it with the data. 
Plot between the test input and corresponding actual output, predicted output are made. 
Find the intercept and slope to plot the line y=mx+c.
It is not possible to calculate accuracy score. 
Accuracy_score is used to measure classification accuracy, it can't be used to measure accuracy of regression model because it doesn't make sense to see accuracy for regression. 
Print the error metrics such as Mean absolute error, Mean sqauared error and root mean squared error  for the regression model
